% # Belka Example Application

-module(belka_example).

% This is a normal Erlang OTP application - it exposes the callbacks
% which are defined in the `application` behaviour.

-behaviour(application).

% ## Public API

% Nothing unusual the normal application API

-export([start/2, stop/1]).

% The `start` function starts the secure socket layer (`ssl`) which Gemini needs

% We define the port using the default `gemini://` port number og `1965`
% (the year of the Mercury mission fact fans).

% In theory this port is conventional - you could change it, but some `gemini://` clients
% don't accept URLs with non-default port numbers in, so YMMV

% `start` also picks up certificates and keys which define this server. `gemini://`
% conventional uses both self-signed keys and self-signed certificates and
% a new set for your server can be generated with the batch file `generate_self_signed_certs.sh`

% ***Remember:*** you gotta edit that batch file with your org name, the URL you are
% serving `gemini://` no and your contact details and stuff

start(_StartType, _StartArgs) ->
